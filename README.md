# DMR11
An application to download manga and other stuff. Despite being based on [MangaRipper](https://github.com/NguyenDanPhuong/MangaRipper), DMR11 is not compatible with MangaRipper. 

DMR11 doesn't exactly use plugins to download things, it follows directives to do so. Without said directives, it doesn't nor is it able to do anything. Check out [Releases](https://github.com/JedBurke/DMR11/releases) for the latest pre-releases.
